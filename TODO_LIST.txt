For Collisions:  The window needs to be broken up into sections and then in each section the paths that the objects will move needs
to be calculated.  If there is a point where the paths would cross the time should be calculated.  If the times are equal then the
necessary physics needs to be done (IE: the objects might just barely skim each other, or may hit head on, both situations would
need to be handled correctly.

 Options should be added to display the force the object is undergoing and the direction of the force etc.  A display of current velocity
would be nice.  Also addition of changing force of gravity.

README should be added sooner or later.
